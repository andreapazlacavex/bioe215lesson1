#Lesson 2 - Computational thinking
- command+shift+r to create subtitles
- "option"" + "-"" to create "<-""
- new built-in functions: min, max, sqrt, abs, max, min
- create new vector
  eg. numbers <- c(5, 2, 26, 8, 16)
- create new vector from another by space:
  eg. new_vector <- vector(vector[1:3])
- create new vector taking values (ie larger than) from an existing vector
  eg. height_over5 <- height[height>5]
- might need to add "na.rm=TRUE/FALSE", depending on the situation
